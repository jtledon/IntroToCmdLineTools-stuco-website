The goal is to just make you better developers and have you leave this class with more knowledge than you came in with

### Docker for this class

The docker image I created for this class is already hosted on dockerhub. All you need to do is run the following command:
```bash
docker pull jasonledon/stuco:latest && \
docker run --rm -it jasonledon/stuco:latest /bin/bash
```
Here is the [Dockerfile](https://intro-to-cmdline-tools.jtledon.com/Dockerfile) itself. It is possible that it's out of date. For the most up to date version, refer to the pre-built image `jasonledon/stuco:latest` on dockerhub

:::caution[Apple Silicon]
If you are running apple silicon, please use the following command. I built a new image that should run on ARM CPU's
```bash
docker pull jasonledon/stuco-cross-arch:latest && \
docker run --rm -it jasonledon/stuco-cross-arch:latest /bin/bash
```
