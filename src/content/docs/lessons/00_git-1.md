## `git` under the hood

### Commits

Commits are static and refer to the hash of the changed code, as well as the hash of the parent commit

### Branches

Branches are just tags that refer to a specific commit. If you commit while attatched to a specific branch, it will update the ref of the branch

### Tags 

Tags are similar to branches, but they stay statically linked to commit even after a new commit

## Viewing status

### `git status`

### `git remote -v`

### `git show {hash}`

### `git log`

## `git` shortcuts

### Aliases

`g`

`git lga` is one of my most used aliases, especially for monitoring the state of 

`git watch`
