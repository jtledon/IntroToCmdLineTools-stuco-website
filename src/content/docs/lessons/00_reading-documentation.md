how to use grep to search output from -h flags
how to use /, j, k to search your pager of choice

* \[optional\] vs \<required\> | \{required\}
* convention of
    * -h: short form with 1 dash
    * --help: long form with 2 dashes
* you can usually chain options together (sometimes fails if they require an argument, or requires that they are the last on the chain)
    * `grep -HnA 3 -B 3`

TODO: make sure that you have a github setup and can
* clone a repo
* push to a repo
    * both prob need ssh keys or maybe username and password
* review the absolute basics of git (clone add commit push)
* if you need any help, reach out to me and I can get you setup, and send you some videos for reference
