## How to Undo

### reset

### restore

### checkout

### revert

This one is primarily for rolling back changes that have already been pushed to a remote repository. You wouldn't want to change the git history and force update the branch because that would throw the entire git history into disarray if someone else has already fetched. Instead, you would revert and generate new commits that undo the change.
