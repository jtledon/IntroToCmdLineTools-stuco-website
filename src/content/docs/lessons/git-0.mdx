## Getting started

### `git clone`

The most common way to get started working in a git repository is to clone it from a hosting provider like GitHub or GitLab.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:jtledon/stuco-intro-to-git.git [cloned directory name]
```

All this is doing is copying all the files from that hosted git repository to your local computer for you to work on.

There are, of course, other flags you can pass in, such as `--bare`, or `--recurse-submodules`, but 98% of the time, that wont be necessary.

### `git init`

This is the other way to get started with a git repository. `git` has the capability to be run completely locally. There is no need to to link to a hosting provider such as GitHub if you dont want to. Just by running:

```bash
$ git init
```

You will create an empty git repository in your current directory. You can make use of all the same file versioning that you otherwise would.

## Interacting with git locally

### `git add`

the `add` command just is one of the most fundamental commands throughout git. It adds files from your working directory, to your staging area.

**working directory**: this is just your current directory and the current state of all your files, modified or not.\
**staging area**: this is all the file snapshots that are going to be included in the next commit.

It is important to note that if you add a file to your staging area, and then make more changes to it, those new changes will not be recorded in the staging area. You will need to `add` it again for those changes to appear in your next commit. You are adding a snapshot of the file in its current state, not the file itself.

```bash
$ git add src/index.html
$ git add public/
```
* The first command will add the `index.html` file, which is in the `src` directory, to the staging area
* The second command will add any untracked or modified files that are in the `public/` directory, or any of its recursive subdirectories

:::note
You will often hear people say, "Don't use `git add .`". I think this is terrible advice.
The sentiment is that you should only include the files that make sense in your current commit, which I agree with. That being said, if _every_ file that has been modified should be included in this commit, it saves so much time writing `git add .`, instead of writing out the full path to every file.
:::

### `git commit`

The `commit` command is what records any of the file snapshots / changes into the local git repository. Commits are meant to represent a single thought or action, such as "feat: adding logout functionality", or "bug: fixing history file truncation".

Commits are the most fundamental objects in git, and are used for almost all other git operations.

The most common way to make a commit is to pass in the commit message while doing so:
```bash
$ git commit -m "Brief description of the change made"
```
If you don't pass it in with the `-m` flag, it will open you `$EDITOR`, which is likely either `nano` or `vim`, to allow you to add the commit message there.

You can also edit your previous commit, but this should __only__ be done if you haven't already pushed your changes to remote repository, as this will modify other's git history.
```bash
$ git commit --amend
```

### Branches

Branches are a way to split up your ongoing changes, and keep your code organized. Every repository has a default "main" branch, but you can make as many as you desire for what you're working on.

There are many ways to make branches. Here are the most common:
```bash
$ git checkout -b feature
$ git branch feature # The previous branch is still active, you have not switched to feature yet
$ git switch -c feature # `git switch` is a relativley new command, intended to replace `git checkout`
```

Whenever you make a commit, that commit will be applied to whatever branch you currently have active. If you make a new commit while

:::note
A branch is essentially just a named commit, _**which updates to reference any new commits that are made what that branch is checked out**_.
:::

### Tags

Tags are literally just named commits. All commits have a hash that you can use to reference them; tags just give human recognizable names to these commits. They are usually used to indicate notable commits, such as software releases, homework checkpoints, etc.

You can list all tags with:
```bash
$ git tag
```

Or create your own tag for the current commit with:
```bash
$ git tag v0.9.5
```

### `git merge`

Merging is a natural action that will occur when working with more than one branch. Eventually, you will want to bring the code from you `feature` branch back into `main`. That can be done in more than one way, but one of the most common is to "merge" that code in.

This is usually done with the following command:
```bash
$ git merge main # if you currently have a branch other than main checked out
```

The branch you have checked out is the one that will be updated, and contain the **merge commit**.

#### resolving a merge conflict

If there are no conflicts between files, or it is clear what the end state of a file should be, git will resolve it directly, however, sometimes that is not the case. If the two branches both modified the same part of a file, git will not know what to do and there will be a conflict.

`git` will notify you if that is the case, and put you in a temporary state while you resolve these conflicts. Once that is done, you can `git add`, and `git merge` like normal to make the merge commit, and it will be resolved.

### `git rebase`

This is the other way to bring the changes from two branches together. Rather than having two branches that get merged with a merge commit, the entirety of the checked out branch (up to their common ancestor commit) gets placed on the head of the target branch

Many teams in industry use this to have a linear, easy to understand commit history. Most teams at Amazon that I worked in or with required this.

```bash
# this will move all commits from the common
# ancestor between main and the current branch,
# and place them on the tip of main
$ git rebase main
```

For the `rebase` command, `-i/--interactive` is a very important flag. It allows a lot of commit manipulation, and is most commonly used for _**squashing**_ commits, which is combining multiple commits into one.

## Interacting with remote repositories

### `git push`

This command is used to put all the changes from your local repository into a remotely hosted repository, usually on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

```bash
$ git push
```

This will sometimes fail if you:
1. Created the repo using `git init` and dont have a remote repo to push to yet
2. Are pushing to branch that doesn't exist on the remote repo yet
3. There is branch protection on the branch you are trying to push to

To resolve these things:
1. `git remote add origin <repo link> && git push -u origin main`
2. `git push --set-upstream origin <branchname>`
3. You will need to submit a Pull Request

:::note
You _can_ have tags in remote repos such as GitHub, but you need to push them manually
```bash
$ git push --tags
```
:::

### `git pull`

This command is really important when working in a team. This is how you get any of the changes that they might have pushed to GitHub, down to your local repository so that you can work on and view them as well

```bash
$ git pull
```

When doing this, do your best to make sure your working directory is clean, otherwise the pull will fail, rather than overwrite your data.

### `git fetch`

This is my preferred way of retrieving changes from a remote repository. What people don't often talk about is that `git pull` is exactly equivalent to `git fetch && git merge`.

When I don't what is the commits that are about to be pulled down, I would rather fetch the updates first, inspect the changes, and then merge once I have decided that it is all clear.

## `git` State

### HEAD / @

This is just the current commit that you are acting on. The HEAD ref can point to a commit, a tag or even just a branch.

### Commits

Commits are static and refer to the hash of the changed code, as well as the hash of the parent commit.

:::note[commit-ish]
For many git commands, you will often see `commit-ish` as a command parameter. This just refers to a possible way of referring to a specific commit. This could be via a `ref`, such as a branch or a tag (or other contents found in `.git/refs/`, or the sha1 hash of a commit)
:::

## Viewing status

### `git diff`

git has a built in way to view the differences between any number of different states in a git repo. You can view the differences between two different branches, between the HEAD commit and the working directory, or even the staged files

```bash
$ git diff # this will show the differences between the working directory and the HEAD commit
$ git diff main feature # this will show the differences between the `main` and `feature` branches
$ git diff @^^ --staged # this will show the difference between your currently staged files, and 2 commits above the HEAD commit
$ git diff -- pathspec # you can limit your diff to only a specific file
$ git diff b68c4d7 # you can diff against a specific commit as well
```

### `git status`

This is my most frequently used git command: its just a way of viewing the current state of the repo. It will show you how many commits havent been pushed to your remote yet, what files have been modified, what files arent being tracked, and a ton of other useful information.

```bash
$ git status
```

I tend to like the abbreviated version of this command, for an update at a glance:
```bash
$ git status --branch --short
```

There are _lots_ of flags, that might be useful; you should take the time to read through them.

### `git log`

Shows you a history of your commits, and a summary of information, including the hash, and commit message. This is nice when you want to get a brief summary of all the changes that have been made, and what commit hashes they correspond to.

```bash
$ git log
```

### `git show`

`git show` is very similar to `git log`: they both show you commit information. The difference is that `show` is made for looking at one specific commit, whereas `log` is made for viewing a range of commits.

Usually you use `git show` to view more information about one commit once you have singled it out after using `git log`
```bash
$ git show {commit-hash}
```

## `git` settings

### git config files

You can set define a file that stores a bunch of configuration changes, called a `gitconfig`. These will generally be located at:
* `/etc/gitconfig`: system-wide git preferences
* `$HOME/.gitconfig` or `$HOME/.config/git/config`: user-specific configurations
* `local-repo/.git/.gitconfig`: repo-specific configurations (ex. )

Usually, a section will have a heading in square brackets, and then their appropriate config options
```bash
[user]
    email = jtledon@gmail.com
    name = Jason Ledon
```

### `g` alias

This is a shell based alias/expansion that allows the letter `g` to expand into `git`. This is a super useful time-save when you're typing the word `git` hundreds of times a day

You need to download `git-completion.bash` and set it up using the following in your `~/.bashrc`
```bash
# https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash
test -f ${PATH_TO}/.git-completion.bash && . $_
__git_complete g __git_main
```

### `git lg[a]`

This is one of my most used aliases, especially for monitoring the state of branches.

It prints out a commandline version of your git graph, so you can keep track of where all you branches, commits, and tags are. It expands out to
`lga = log --color --graph --format="'%C(red)%h%C(reset) -%C(yellow)%d%C(reset) %s %C(green)(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%C(reset)'" --abbrev-commit --date-order --exclude=refs/stash --all`

## GitHub

### ssh keys

Often times, you will need to setup ssh-keys to be able to push to a repository on github, even if its your own. I have a brief video [here](https://youtu.be/NRXBMrsCeIY?si=7WgnyF4CaYNCNlp4) about how to add ssh-keys to your account.

### difference between git and github

I just want to re-iterate the differences between `git` the command-line tool, and GitHub, the service. `git` will work locally and manages the version control of your code. GitHub is a service that hosts your repos on the cloud for off-site backups, sharing, etc and adds additional features like Pull Requests and Issues.

## Great resources

* The [official git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/) is amazing, and incredibly clear
* Interactive tools
    * A great [git visualizer](https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/)
    * A great website for [learning the basics](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

## Homework
Everyone should have received an invite to be a collaborator on a git repo that I made
1. Accept that invite
2. Clone the `git@github.com:jtledon/stuco-intro-to-git.git` repo
3. Make a new branch with the same name as your CMU alias
4. Make a few commits
5. Push your new branch to the repo.

:::caution[Possible Errors]
There might be issues about not having an upstream branch. Try resolving it on your own first, and if you are still having a hard time, reach out on slack.

You might also run into issues about not having an ssh-key linked to your account. I have an old video on it [here](https://youtu.be/NRXBMrsCeIY?si=7WgnyF4CaYNCNlp4) that might help. There are times where you will also need to manually add it to Mac's Keychain, or your `ssh-agent` on linux. I can assist with that if need be.
