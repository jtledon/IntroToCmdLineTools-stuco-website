# Network Requests

## Web Interactions

### `curl` (cURL)

We've already used it a ton in this class; `curl` allows you to send general network requests via the command-line. By default, the downloaded content is written to stdout
```bash
$ curl -s https://intro-to-cmdline-tools.jtledon.com/parsetext/jledon.txt 2> /dev/null | grep ...
```
The above structure is a very common way to format a pipeline of commands. Request some amount of data from a url and then perform some operations on it - in this case, grep.

Some of the most common flags that you will find useful:
```bash
$ curl [--header|-H] # send http headers in the curl request
$ curl [--data.*] # send various forms of POST request data
$ curl [--output|-o] # rather than writing to stdout, write to a file instead
```

#### Chrome requests

`wget` tends to be used for strictly downloading content from websites, rather than

wgeti - for downloading websites
