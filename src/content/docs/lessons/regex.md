## RegEx
Impossible to read, but super powerful for text processing and searching

### RegEx engines
There are different engines for regex, each with their own syntax and abilities
PCRE / PCRE2

One really common example is that in most cases, if you want to match a digit, you can use the `\d` string. In both `sed` and `awk` (which we will talk about next class), `\d` doesn't exist; instead you need to use `[[:digit:]]`.
