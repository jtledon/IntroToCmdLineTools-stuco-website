## Benefits
* Some form of vi or vim will be on every linux computer or server
* Useful when doing SSH work because it runs in the commandline and doesnt require a GUI or X11 Forwarding support
* You can customize it to fit exactly what your preference it. You have access to the entire API: you arent locked to some json config files.
* Using vim encourages you to learn about how exactly your editor and environment works
* vim gives you a language to more naturally express your changes

## History
* ed
    * short for "editor"
    * pioneered the idea of modal text editing
    * was designed for an used in an era when you could only display one line of text at a time
* vi
    * expanded on the groundwork laid out by ed
    * allows you to view multiple lines at once
    * created the idea text object objects and actions
* vim
    * [Vi] I[m]proved
    * The pesonal project of a man named Bram Moolenaar
    * The binary is written in C but the configuration is done in a bespoke language he made called "vim-script"
* nvim
    * community maintained version of vim
    * configured using the `lua` programming language

## Changes are atomic
When editing text in vim, you should think about it in terms of actions on text objects, not as modifying individual characters.

Actions generally respect the following structure\
`[repetitions] + operation + target`\
`[count] + verb + noun`

`[c]hange [w]ord`\
`2 [c]hange [w]ord`

`.` repeats that

vim tries very hard to make fit all commands as mnemonics for the action it performs:
* [**c**]hange
* [**d**]elete
* [**i**]nsert
* [**a**]ppend
* [**p**]aste
* [**y**]ank (copy)

## Modal editor
`vim` is a modal editor. It is unlike most other text editors where you can just navigate to a location and start typing. You need to enter the insert mode before you can do that.

* **Normal mode**: Normal mode is the mode you start in. It allows you do navigate around the document and in the landing point between other modes.
* **Insert mode**: The mode that actually lets you enter text.
* **Visual mode**: The "highlight" mode. It allows you to visually make selections before performing operations on them.
* **Command mode**: Allows you to interact with the extensive set of vim commands

## vim Motions
Even if you don't switch to using `vim` full time as your editor like I have, I think you should at least try using vim motions in your IDE. Intellij, VSCode, Zed, Sublime, and all major text editors have vim bindings.

* Basic motions
    * `j` - down
    * `k` - up
    * `h` - left
    * `l` - right
* Word movements
    * `w` - word
    * `e` - end of word
    * `b` - back
* Jump
    * `f <letter>` - forward
    * `F <letter>` - inverse of forward (backwards)
    * `t <letter>` - til (until)
    * `T <letter>` - inverse of til
* General navigation
    * `gg` - go top
    * `G` - go bottom
    * `^` - first (non-whitespace) character on a line
    * `$` - last character on a line
* Copying
    * `y` - yank
    * `p` - paste
* Entering insert mode
    * `i` - insert
    * `I` - insert at the front of the line
    * `a` - append
    * `A` - append at the end of the line

### Text Objects
One of the best things about vim is that it defines text objects that you can interact with. Some examples are:
* `iw` - inside word
* `i"` - inside quotes
* `a}` - around curly braces
* `it` - inside tag

These can all be combined with actions such as delete, change, visual selection

## vim commands

* `:q[!]`
* `:wq` (write and quit)
* search
    * `/`
    * `?`
    * `n`
    * `N`
* `:set wrap`

## Plugins
vim and nvim are made to be extensible so the community has made thousands of plugins that do pretty much anything you might need. Some of the ones that I cant live without:
* nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim
* hrsh7th/nvim-cmp
* theprimeagen/harpoon
* mbbill/undotree
* numToStr/Comment.nvim
* kylechui/nvim-surround or tpope/vim-surround
* mg979/vim-visual-multi
* wellle/targets.vim
* tpope/vim-repeat

Some plugins extend this concept of actions you can perform on text objects.

`*-surround` plugins allows add some really useful actions onto these text objects
* `cs"'` - change surrounding " to '
* `ysiw]` - y surround inside word ]
* `dsf` - delete surround function

## Interacting with the nvim api in the editor
```bash
$ :lua vim.api.nvim_get
```
* `:lua` - execute a lua chunk of code
* `vim.api`

## Niceties

### Capslock -> ESC
When using vi/vim/nvim, you find yourself pressing Escape a lot to switch between modes and cancel operations. This can be cumbersome considering how far the ESC key is on most keyboards. I personally remap the capslock key to behave as the ESC key, and I recommend that anyone who uses vim does the same.

In Windows you can use AutoHotkey
```txt
#Requires AutoHotKey v2.0+
#Warn  ; Enable warnings to assist with detecting common errors.
SendMode "Input"  ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
SetWorkingDir A_ScriptDir  ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.
#SingleInstance Force

; Capslock send ESC key
Capslock::Esc

; Shift+Capslock will toggle Capslock state
+CapsLock:: {
    SetCapsLockState(!GetKeyState("CapsLock", "T"))
}
```
### $EDITOR env var
If you want to define `vim` or `neovim` as the default editor in your shell, you can export the `EDITOR` environment variable. This will set your preferred editor to open when dealing with things such as commit messages.
```bash
$ export EDITOR=nvim
```
