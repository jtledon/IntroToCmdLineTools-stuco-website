## Benefits
* Some form of vi or vim will be on every linux computer or server
* Useful when doing SSH work because it runs in the commandline and doesnt require a GUI or X11 Forwarding support
* You can customize it to fit exactly what your preference it. You have access to the entire API: you arent locked to some json config files.
* Using vim encourages you to learn about how exactly your editor and environment works

## History
* ed
    * short for "editor"
    * pioneered the idea of modal text editing
    * was designed for an used in an era when you could only display one line of text at a time
* vi
    * expanded on the groundwork laid out by ed
    * allows you to view multiple lines at once
    * created the idea text object objects and actions
* vim
    * [Vi] I[m]proved
    * The pesonal project of a man named Bram Moolenaar
    * The binary is written in C but the configuration is done in a bespoke language he made called "vim-script"
* nvim
    * community maintained version of vim
    * configured using the `lua` programming language

## Changes are atomic
When editing text in vim, you should think about it in terms of actions on text objects, not as modifying individual characters

`[c]hange [w]ord`


`.` repeats that
[count] + verb + noun
[repetitions] + operation + target
Try to remember everything as a neumonic

## Modal editor
### Normal mode
### Insert mode
### Visual mode
### Command mode
### Transition Diagram

## vim Motions
Even if you don't switch to using `vim` full time as your editor like I have, I think you should at least try using vim motions in your IDE. Intellij, VSCode, Zed, Sublime, etc. all have vim motion bindings.

## Niceties

### Capslock -> ESC
When using vi/vim/nvim, you find yourself pressing Escape a lot to switch between modes and cancel operations. This can be cumbersome considering how far the ESC key is on most keyboards. I personally remap the capslock key to behave as the ESC key, and I recommend that anyone who uses vim does the same.

In Windows you can use AutoHotkey
```txt
#Requires AutoHotKey v2.0+
#Warn  ; Enable warnings to assist with detecting common errors.
SendMode "Input"  ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
SetWorkingDir A_ScriptDir  ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.
#SingleInstance Force

; Capslock send ESC key
Capslock::Esc

; Shift+Capslock will toggle Capslock state
+CapsLock:: {
    SetCapsLockState(!GetKeyState("CapsLock", "T"))
}
```
### $EDITOR env var
If you want to define `vim` or `neovim` as the default editor in your shell, you can export the `EDITOR` environment variable. This will set your preferred editor to open when dealing with things such as commit messages.
```bash
$ export EDITOR=nvim
```

## Additional References
* `:Tutor` - a command that takes you to a vim practice session where you can practice with motions

* There is no substitution for time in the editor and practice if this is something you want to get good at.
